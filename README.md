A digital photo frame (also called a digital media frame) is a picture frame that displays digital photos without the need of a computer or printer. The introduction of digital photo frames predates tablet computers, which can serve the same purpose in some situations; however, digital photo frames are generally designed specifically for the stationary, aesthetic display of photographs and therefore usually provide a nicer-looking frame and a power system designed for continuous use.With the pictures the photo frame also displays reminders and also controls the medicine dispenser.The main aim to design the photoframe is to make it useful to people who cannot use smartphones and facebook.
